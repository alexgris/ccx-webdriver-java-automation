Test automation code using Selenium WebDriver + Java + Maven + TestNG on CCX project using Silverlight

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This Java-based test automation script is a fully functional code created for a real online tendering system. The source code is
not meant for installation & running. Instead it can be used as an example of ready-to-use solutions for most commonly encountered 
problems and situations that many software developers in test (SDETs) may come into while automating regression tests using
Selenium WebDriver with Java.
